step by step : 

1. use feather image of an extended molecular emission : 
            ***choose an specific range of channels with the most emissions and save the slice by "imsubimage" task in casa 
            ***save the image format in fits format ("exportfits" in CASA)
          

2. create a mask image : 
            *** produce moment zero image , 
            *** make fits file , 
            *** plot fits file as .png image or from ds9 export as a png
                note: it should working with fits image as well 

3.  run disperse via following commad : 
        >>> mse molecule_subimage.fits -mask mask.png -interactive -upSkl
            
            actuall error and how to solve them 
            ***  ERROR: could not open binary for 'pdview' (-interactive).
                        Try specifying the location: '-interactive <full/path/to/pdview>'
                Solution:  ??? (wanna ask SU)
                
            ***  ERROR in setMask: mask and data do not have the same size.
                 
                 Solution : this is because of the dimention of your data, if you use the normmal fits file which have 4 dim and 
                 the .png image with 2 dim as the masked image then you will get this error.                                                  To avoid this problem, use the moment zero as actual fits file and .png file as the mask image. 
                 
                 rewrite the correct command in the following : 
                 
        >>> H13COp_subimage_moment0.fits_c0.124.up.NDskl.BRK.S006.TRIM.ASMB.vtp
        
                 The GUI opens after this run and you can see the image similar to (image/im_1_dens_pers_diag.png)                            Via this image you can check the persistence diagram as it deeply reflects the topological nature of the                      distribution and can be used to understand it better. For instance, the following diagram (represented by a                  2D histogram of the pairs distribution, instead of the pairs themselves) was computed from a totally                          different map
            
                 here you should to select lg(X) and lg(Y) to get logaritmic image for a better view. 
            
                 Then (Control+left click) on the image shows the pink line which is associated to the "persistence                            threshold" (in image shows the number ~6.E20 (from the Y-axis)).
            
                 Also the green line shows that the nature of the distribution is different for background values below or                    above "X=~4E20" on the X-axis. you can choose the value manually by looking the momment0.fits file on ds9,                    select a small region, double click to open a new winde, select analysis bottom and then statistics , read                    the noise level. choose a number roughly three times more. this defines for parameter named "-trimBelow".                    This feature reflects the fact that in some regions of this data-set, the signal was below the instrument                    detection threshold and the result is complex noise generated by the detectors.
