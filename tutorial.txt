step by step : 

1. use feather image of an extended molecular emission : 
            ***choose an specific range of channels with the most emissions and save the slice by "imsubimage" task in casa 
            ***save the image format in fits format ("exportfits" in CASA)
          

2. create a mask image : 
            *** produce moment zero image , 
            *** make fits file , 
            *** plot fits file as .png image or from ds9 export as a png
                note: it should working with fits image as well 

3.  run disperse via following commad : 
        >>> mse molecule_subimage.fits -mask mask.png -interactive -upSkl
            
            actuall error and how to solve them 
            ***  ERROR: could not open binary for 'pdview' (-interactive).
                        Try specifying the location: '-interactive <full/path/to/pdview>'
                Solution:  ??? (wanna ask SU)
                
            ***  ERROR in setMask: mask and data do not have the same size.
                 
                 Solution : this is because of the dimention of your data, if you use the normmal fits file which have 4 dim and 
                 the .png image with 2 dim as the masked image then you will get this error. 
                 To avoid this problem, use the moment zero as actual fits file and .png file as the mask image. 
                 rewrite the correct command in the following : 
                 
        >>> H13COp_subimage_moment0.fits_c0.124.up.NDskl.BRK.S006.TRIM.ASMB.vtp
        
            The GUI opens after this
